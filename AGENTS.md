# Heads up
- This repository is my testing grounds for new updates for my extension in it's main repository. The public release of the extension is on v3.5.0, and this repository will become v3.6.0

# SillyTavern Costume Switch contributor notes

- Use four spaces for indentation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.
- Favor double quotes for string literals to match the existing style.
- Keep experimental or in-progress features clearly gated behind their feature flags.
- Update or add tests in the `test/` directory when you change profile persistence or detection logic.
- Document noteworthy UI affordances or feature flags in the settings copy so users understand experimental scope.
- Document noteworthy changes in CHANGELOG.md to contribute to the future releases changelog. If CHANGELOG.md is still set for the previous or currently released version, then reset it and prep it for future release.
- Use `rpg-companion-sillytavern/` for help if needed. Remember, `rpg-companion-sillytavern/` is for reference ONLY, and not to be touched.

# Help
- `for-help-only/` is a folder containing 3 different extensions, along with a bunch of scripts for you to look at. They are for help and reference only, meaning you aren't allowed to edit them.
